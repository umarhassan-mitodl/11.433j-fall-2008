Course Meeting Times
--------------------

Lectures: 2 sessions / week, 1.5 hours / session

Recitations: 1 session / week, 1.5 hours / session

Course Information
------------------

This course applies the latest economic thinking and research to the task of analyzing real estate market fundamentals, forecasting supply and demand, and choosing locations. In addition to the two weekly lectures and assigned readings, the course involves 5 largely computer-based exercises (30% of grade), and a midterm and final exam (each 35% of grade). The exams are 1.5 hours each and cover material in each half of the course.

There are two types of course materials. First, there will be 12 lecture note files that represent the material in the lectures (see outline below). This material represents a significant update and expansion of the following text:

DiPasquale, Denise, and William Wheaton. _Urban Economics and Real Estate Markets_. Upper Saddle River, NJ: Prentice Hall, 1995. ISBN: 9780132252447.

The lecture files will enable students to cover the material without purchase of the text. Second, there is a set of journal articles that are required reading; see the {{% resource_link 795e7d98-bb39-3a05-58d0-c61b5faf496b "readings" %}} section.
